              "'Division of Economic & Financial Opportunity (DEFO)    Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and SBS are committed to encouraging a competitive and diverse New York City business environment by promoting the growth and success of minority and women-owned companies.  New York Cityâ\\x80\\x99s Minority and Women-owned Business Enterprise (M/WBE) program is designed to help these historically underserved groups become more competitive.    JOB DESCRIPTION           The Account Manager will provide a range of supportive services to City agency purchasing personnel and private-sector prime contractors to help them comply with M/WBE utilization goals under Local Law 129.  The Account Manager will oversee a portfolio of several City agencies and will be responsible for the monitoring and oversight of the strategies which have been broadly laid out for agencies to increase M/WBE utilization.  The primary objective for the Account Manager is to help agencies increase the number and dollar value of contracts awarded to M/WBE at various contract levels.  Specifically, the Account Manager will seek to bring agencies into compliance with the Citywide utilization goals and other metrics used for measuring agency performance. Each account manager will be responsible for procurements of all sizes and methods for their respective agencies.  The Account Manager will report to the Director of Procurement Initiatives.    Account Manager Model  Each agency has very specific vendor requirements and needs, as well as obstacles to increasing M/WBE Utilization. The account managers will learn what is procured, by what method, how frequently, and how to get more M/WBEs participating in the process. The account manager will leverage their procurement contacts to work directly with program end users to identify needs and obstacles and create appropriate solutions.
